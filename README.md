The Game!

A maze game to find and eliminate your enemies.

Features:

1. Collision detection:
   The player is unable to walk through walls
2. Minimap:
   The player can activate a minimap to be able to orient themselves in the maze
3. Orientation:
   The north-south and east-west facing walls are colored differently so the player is better able to orient themselves.

About:
For a very long time I have always wanted to be able to build something cool using C appart from the usual embended system projects. This project comes as a personal victory to me as I have been able to make my idea of a maze game come true.
